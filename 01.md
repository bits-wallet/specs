One-directional channels
-------------------------------

`draft` `mandatory` `author:burak`

This BDS defines BitsApp channels to operate one-way only for the interactivity benefits.

## Rationale

Building a lightning client is challenging. What is more challenging is building a non-interactive lightning client. Due to the interactive nature of lightning, clients face two main challenges:

### Uptime monitoring
Clients must remain online to monitor the network for channel breaches and act accordingly when needed. Running uptime software is unlikely for non-interactive clients such as mobile wallets and web clients.

### Channel backups
Lightning clients must back up old channel states to be able to broadcast penalty transactions in case of a breach. Channel backup size grows in proportion to the number of payments. This is a huge drawback for web clients that have limited IndexedDB resources.

## Specification
BDS-01 proposes to establish BitsApp a send-only lightning wallet and restricting the receiving part to on-chain. A send-only lightning design makes payment channels operate one-way-only, making previous channel states become in favor of the user at all times. This way, users don't need to back-up old channel states as they are all in favor of themselves. The most favorable outcome for the channel partner (LSP) is to broadcast the latest-state-only. For the same reasons, users don't need to make periodic penalty checks with the bitcoin network and remain offline for a long period.
