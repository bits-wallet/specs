Channel Addresses
-------------------------------

`draft` `mandatory` `author:brqgoo`

This BDS defines a non-interactive channel opening scheme.

## Rationale

Today, funding outpoints must be known before establishing a new channel to craft a refund from the 2-of-2 multisig. This has three main drawbacks:

### On-chain footprint
Cannot allow batch openings, consuming more on-chain footprint. A third party (i.e. on-ramp exchange) cannot open a channel for two other parties (between the user and LSP), among other outputs. Note that Vortex enables batch openings as a side result but requires interactivity pre-channel formation.

### On-chain privacy
In comparison to batch openings, regular channel establishments are less privacy-preserving. Funding transaction consumes one or more inputs, a channel output, and a probabilistic change. It might have two changes if dual-funded. On-chain observers MAY have an idea whether this might be a funding transaction.

### Convenience
Inconvenient for onboarding new users who have no UTXO possession in the beginning.

## Specification
This BDS proposes a non-interactive channel opening scheme called _channel addresses_. _Channel addresses_ make it possible to craft on-chain bitcoin addresses such that when funded, becomes a payment channel between _to_self_ and _to_remote_, where the channel funds are initially kept on _to_self_ side.

The specification first defines how to derive child public keys from a parent _npub_ using  plain tweaking. Then passing derived child keys to key aggregation algorithm (KeyAgg) to obtain the aggregate public key, and finally applying an x-only tweak to 2-of-2 aggregate public key to add a single-leaf script path. The added script path enforces a non-interactive refund closure that permits _to_self_ to spend funds after a relative locktime, similar to pre-segwit timeout channel design.

Adding a non-interactive refund closure to a 2-of-2 multisig removes the need to craft a refund transaction in advance of funding a channel output. _to_self_ can exit from the script path after the expiry if the _to_remote_ happens to be non-collaborative in exchanging signatures for a refund.

Ultimately, it's _to_remote_ responsibility to close the channel shortly before channel expiry. While this design consume more on-chain footprint over time than a regular channel formations, its anticipated _to_self_ users to mostly receive funds over [_silent swaps_](https://github.com/bits-wallet/specs/blob/main/04.md) and rarely through _channel addresses_.

## Crafting Channel Addresses

 The number  _u_  of the number of channel addresses: _2<sup>32</sup>_.
### Child Key Derivation
 - The nostr parent secret key _nsec_: a 32-byte array.
 - The nostr parent public key _npub_: _cbytes(int(nsec)⋅G)_.
 - The tweak derivation secret  _ds_: a 32-byte array. 
 - Let _ds_ = _hash<sub>BDS-02/dersec</sub>(nsec)_.
 -  For _i = 1 .. u_:
 - - The BDS-02 child secret key _sk<sub>i</sub>_.
 - - The BDS-02 child public key _pk<sub>i</sub>_.
 - - pk<sub>i</sub> BIP-340 tweak t<sub>i</sub> : 32-byte array.
 - - Let _t<sub>i</sub>_ = _hash<sub>BDS-02/tweak</sub>(ds || bytes(32, i))_.
 - - Let _pk<sub>i</sub>_ = _cbytes(npub + int(t<sub>i</sub>)⋅G)_.
 - - Let _sk<sub>i</sub>_ = _bytes(32, (int(nsec) + int(t<sub>i</sub> )) mod n)_.

### Key Aggregation
-  For _i = 1 < u< 2<sup>32</sup>_:
- - The _to_self_ :  32-byte x-only user child public key.
- - The _to_remote_ :  32-byte x-only well-known LSP public key.
- - The _keygen_ctx_ :  MuSig2 keygen context containing the aggregate key.
- - Let _to_self_ = _cbytes(pk<sub>i</sub>)_.
- - Let _to_remote_ = _cbytes(bytes(33, 0x025de7cd8fd3a0a38f1cab124defd4c3043203c3f2b66328484e321d3ede5f84f6))_.
- -  Let _keygen_ctx<sub>i</sub>_ = _KeyAgg([to_self, to_remote])_.
- -  Let Q<sub>i</sub>, gacc<sub>i</sub>, and , tacc<sub>i</sub> = _keygen_ctx<sub>i</sub>_.

### Adding Refund Closure
-  For _i = 1 < u< 2<sup>32</sup>_:
- - The _ex_ :  a 2-byte minimally encoded channel expiry as relative locktime.
- - The _ts_ : a 39-byte raw tapscript for a non-interactive refund closure.
- - - The _addr_ : Expiring channel address.
- - Let  _ex_ = _CScriptNum(26280)_.
- - Let  _ts_ = `<ex> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP <to_self> OP_CHECKSIG`.
- - Let _ts<sub>hash</sub>_ = _hash<sub>TapLeaf</sub>(0xc0 || 0x27 || ts)_.
- - Let _ts<sub>tweak</sub>_ = _hash<sub>TapTweak</sub>(xbytes(Q<sub>i</sub>) || ts<sub>hash</sub>)_.
- -  Let _keygen_ctx'_ = _ApplyTweak(Q<sub>i</sub>, ts<sub>tweak</sub>, true)_.
- - Let Q'<sub>i</sub>, gacc'<sub>i</sub>, and , tacc'<sub>i</sub> = _keygen_ctx'<sub>i</sub>_.
- -  Let _addr_ = Bech32m(bytes(34, 0x5120 || xbytes(Q'<sub>i</sub>))).
